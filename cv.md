# Summary (your goal, wishes, reveal what is important for you, what do you want and why.
My main goal is to change my career path into something new and challenging. My strongest advantage is a high engineering culture grown by my current work as a senior medical equipment service engineer where you need an ability to do your work without any errors. 
Here is a shortlist of my advantages: I have a great passion to learn and to teach my younger colleagues, able to estimate the terms and do my best to minimize them. My personal traits are fearlessness, curiosity and that kind of perseverance you need to continue working even if you are tired and hopeless.
